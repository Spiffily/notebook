        <p>D11 has been really busy working on a better system for Webex, and now they have it! Going forward, logging in will be more consistent from teacher to teacher, it will be super easy to schedule office hours and more. But what does this mean? Let's check it out.</p>
        <p>As of this weekend, all students and staff now have a Webex account. That's right! Now in order to get into your class on Webex, you'll need to be signed in. This may sound like an extra, annoying step, but it (hopefully) means that we won't have the problem of your computer dying and you having to email your teacher to let you back into class from the lobby!</p>

        <h2>So how do I get in?</h2>
        <p>The video below was included in an email about these changes, and it does a great job talking you through the process. Please check it out and try it yourself! (Although maybe don't try to schedule office hours unless you need them... ðŸ˜‰)</p>

        <p>Make sure you understand this process super well and maybe even practice a bit beforehand. Make sure that this Tuesday you use the new system so that you end up in the right class! If it's not working, please be understanding. The teachers are giving their best and then some. Good luck!</p>
