      <h1>Step 1 - The template</h1>
      <p>The Notebook has already put together a comprehensive template that covers the major components of your page. In order to keep the site consistent and smooth, do not depart from it more than is nesecary.</p>
      <p>Any templates which change the page header formatting, the tab title, the favicon, etc, will not be accepted.</p>

      <h1>Writing an Article</h1>
      <p>The whole point of The Digital Notebook is that Students can share knowldege that should help make E-learning just a bit easier. If no one shares their knowledge, we wouldn't have a site!</p>
      <p>When writing an article, you have two options. If you are not tech savvy in any way, you may write your article in a <code>.odt</code> format and sumbit it with all pictures in a <code>.zip</code> archive.</p>
      <p>However, if you are somewhat tech savvy, we would certainly prefer you to use our html template. It's much easier than you think, and we've done all the hard parts for you. Also, when you use this method, you know what your page is going to look like, and you can easily ensure it's formatted the way you want.</p>
